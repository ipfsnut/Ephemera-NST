Here's how we could approach it:

We'd create a single source of truth for the experiment state using Redux.

The NumberSwitchingTask component would be a container component, responsible for fetching the initial experiment data and rendering the appropriate sub-components based on the current state.

We'd implement a clear state machine for the experiment with distinct states: INITIALIZING, READY, SHOWING_DIGIT, AWAITING_RESPONSE, TRIAL_COMPLETE, and EXPERIMENT_COMPLETE.

Each state would correspond to a specific sub-component, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

We'd use Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk for API calls, handling loading, success, and error states efficiently.

The component would use useSelector to access only the necessary pieces of state, minimizing re-renders.

Transitions between states would be triggered by dispatching actions, ensuring a unidirectional data flow.

This approach aligns with React and Redux best practices, providing a scalable and maintainable structure for managing the complex state of the Number Switching Task experiment.
