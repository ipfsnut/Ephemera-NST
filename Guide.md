# Number Switching Task Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps to implement the Number Switching Task within our existing React application, including data collection and export functionality.

## Steps

1. Create Number Switching Task Module
   - Create a new directory: `src/components/NumberSwitchingTask`
   - Add main component file: `index.js`
   - Create sub-components: `Instructions.js`, `TaskInterface.js`, `ResultsDisplay.js`

2. Implement Redux Slice
   - Create `src/redux/numberSwitchingSlice.js`
   - Define initial state, actions, and reducers
   - Include actions for starting task, recording responses, and ending task

3. Update Main Store
   - Modify `src/redux/store.js` to include the new numberSwitchingSlice

4. Implement Camera Functionality
   - Create `src/utils/camera.js` for camera-related functions
   - Implement function to capture image every 3-5 key presses

5. Create Data Storage Utility
   - Add `src/utils/dataStorage.js`
   - Implement functions to store task data and images locally

6. Develop Export Functionality
   - Create `src/utils/exportData.js`
   - Implement function to generate ZIP file with CSV and JPG images

7. Update Routing
   - Modify `src/App.js` to include route for Number Switching Task

8. Integrate with Event Structure
   - Update `src/components/EventDetail.js` to link to Number Switching Task

9. Implement Main Task Logic
   - In `src/components/NumberSwitchingTask/index.js`:
     - Set up task states and timers
     - Implement logic for switching between number types
     - Handle user input and score calculation

10. Create User Interface
    - Design and implement UI components in respective files
    - Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes

11. Connect Redux and Components
    - Use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` in components to interact with Redux store

12. Implement Data Collection
    - Integrate camera capture with key presses
    - Store task data and images using storage utility

13. Add Export Option
    - Create export button in `ResultsDisplay.js`
    - Connect export functionality to generate and download ZIP file

14. Testing and Refinement
    - Conduct thorough testing of all components and functionalities
    - Refine user experience based on test results

## Key Considerations
- Ensure smooth integration with existing event structure
- Optimize performance for simultaneous task running and image capture
- Implement secure local storage for task data and images
- Design intuitive user interface for task instructions and execution
